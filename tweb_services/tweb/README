tweb (an hardened thttpd)
Version 2.00 xx of 2014

This is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.
(xx is the enhancement package number.)

Simple: It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.

It also has a very small run-time size, since it does not fork and
 is very careful about memory allocation.

Portable: It compiles cleanly on FreeBSD 2.x/3.x, SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x,
BSD/OS 2.x, Linux 1.2.x, OSF/1 (on a 64-bit Alpha), and no doubt many others.

Fast: In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers
(Apache, NCSA, Netscape).  Under extreme load it's much faster.

Secure: It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine
against attacks and breakins from other sites.
Now it's secure against shellshock attack.

It also has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based throttling) that
no other server currently has.

See the manual entry for more details.
