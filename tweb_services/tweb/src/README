tweb
+++
Inspired on something robust!

To test this, run:
	./tweb -u $USER -c '*'.cgi -nov -p 8080 -D -d ..


You can specify an alternate lockfile(), setenv LOCKOUT_FILE, e.g.
	export LOCKOUT_FILE=/tmp/${USER}_lockfile.dat


Files with an executable bit (on 'others'), S_IXOTH (octal 00001) are
requested to be 'cgi's, otherwise the following warning was generated:
	Dec 26 23:00:15 HOST tweb[2564]: 127.0.0.1 URL "/Folder.jpg" is executable but isn't CGI
The following exceptions are allowed now, by default:
	libhttpd.c:#define ALLOWED_EXE_MASK_EXT
		*.mp3|*.jpg|*.jpeg
	and the corresponding upper-case extensions.
