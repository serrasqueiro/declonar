## Motivation

Here is currently just one script.

- `agua.py`
  + It uses old-fashioned packages that read Excel (without openpyxl), 
    but often dates get the annoying numeric excel format, and time is also poorly converted.
  + However, it reads data from [SIMAS](https://www.aquamatrix.pt/SIMASnet/ReadingsAndConsumptions) 
    (portuguese, Lisbon area _Water and Sewers_).
